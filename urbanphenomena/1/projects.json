This entails developing an Architectural Identity that breaks away from the conventional and commercial models currently built throughout the city. The extra building space has been utilized for services due to limited parking space that define the number of possible units. The building is to be efficient in cost and maintenance; minimal and neat in detail and design.",

Due to recent socio-economic trends, young families have widened their horizons through media or travel on their living preference. This prototype aims to break the rigid grip imposed by the real estate market on these young families.<br><br>The living room and kitchen overlook a small semi-enclosed courtyard, inspired from the traditional Arab house. However, its connection with the exterior garden creates an extension of the interior and constitutes the center of the house providing indirect sunlight without compromising privacy. A perfectly fit set of dualities of past meeting present, traditional meeting modern day and spacious yet private. Al-Wesal Semi Detached Units are indeed a picture-perfect fit for today’s Arab young families.<br><br>The design of the developmental project dictated the use of efficient and economical building materials and construction methods. The layout of spaces groups all utilities near to the middle part of the both units, creating a sort of core, where vertical circulation and WC facilities are located. This significantly saves on the amount of ducts and pipes used for utilities and frees up more space for the main functions of the residence, providing residents with comfortable and spacious spaces for living.",
